Roles and Responsibilities
============================
To ensure everything runs smoothly and consistently, various types of users have specific roles within the system. Each role comes with its own set of responsibilities, which are regularly adjusted to meet the system's needs and requirements.

Asset Owners
-----------------
These users occupy the top layer of the system and are responsible for managing and sharing their asset details with real-world users. They also oversee strategic planning and managerial activities to ensure their assets are efficiently utilized.
