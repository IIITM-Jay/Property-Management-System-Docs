Searching And Exporting
=========================

Search
--------------
In order to enhance the efficiency of the searching process, the system provides two filters: **Property type** and **Location**. These filters enable users to narrow down their search results more effectively, making it easier to find properties that match their specific requirements. Whether you are looking for a specific property type or a particular location, these filters will assist you in quickly discovering the most relevant options available within the system.

1. **Property Type:** This filter greatly simplifies the user's property search, allowing them to easily find the specific type of property they are looking for. Whether it's a Home, Hotel, Hostel, or even a college classroom, the filter streamlines the process and ensures that the user can quickly identify and explore the options that match their specific preferences and needs.


2. **Loation:** With the help of location-based filtering, users can effortlessly search for assets in their immediate area. This feature allows them to focus on properties and assets that are geographically close to their desired location, making it convenient and efficient to find options that suit their needs and preferences.

Export
-------------
If a user wishes to view all properties in one go, they have the option to download the entire collection of assets in Excel format. This feature enables customers to explore and gather information about all the different rentals available in the system at their own pace. By having access to the comprehensive list, users can make well-informed decisions and easily reserve the properties that best meet their specific requirements and preferences.
