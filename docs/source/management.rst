Management & Administration
==============================

Managers and Administrators
-----------------------------
The property management system is thoughtfully designed to efficiently handle all aspects of administration and management. 
It offers a user-friendly interface that allows administrators to manage property listings with ease, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for real-world users. 
Administrators have the flexibility to customize website layouts, providing diverse user experiences based on different device screens and window sizes.
User authentication and role-based access empower administrators to delegate responsibilities effectively and manage various user types within the system. 
By utilizing middle layer users, the system streamlines strategic planning and managerial activities, bridging the gap between property owners and real-world users. 
The system's adaptability allows administrators to modify user roles and responsibilities as needed to accommodate changing demands and requirements.
